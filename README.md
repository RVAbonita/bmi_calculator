The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator Application is a software project developed to provide a user-friendly tool for calculating and assessing an individual's Body Mass Index, a widely used measure of body weight relative to height. This application caters to health-conscious individuals seeking a convenient way to monitor and evaluate their body composition.

The BMI Calculator App is designed to make it super simple for you to figure out your BMI. 
Just tell it your height and weight, and it'll calculate your BMI and tell you if you're underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
